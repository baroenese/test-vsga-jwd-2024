The company was founded in 2002 by Elon Musk with the goal of reducing space transportation costs and ultimately developing a sustainable colony on Mars. The company currently produces and operates the Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy rockets along with the Dragon and Starship spacecraft.</p>
                    <p className="text-xl text-black leading-8 font-normal mb-2 text-justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The company offers internet service via its Starlink subsidiary, which became the largest-ever satellite constellation in January 2020 and, as of April 2024, comprised more than 6,000 small satellites in orbit.</p>
                    <p className="text-xl text-black leading-8 font-normal mb-2 text-justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile, the company is developing Starship, a human-rated, fully-reusable, super heavy-lift launch system for interplanetary and orbital spaceflight. On its first flight in April 2023, it became the largest and most powerful rocket ever flown. The rocket reached space on its second flight that took place in November 2023.</p>
                    <p className="text-xl text-black leading-8 font-normal mb-2 text-justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SpaceX is the first private company to develop a liquid-propellant rocket that has reached orbit; to launch, orbit, and recover a spacecraft; to send a spacecraft to the International Space Station; and to send astronauts to the International Space Station. It is also the first organization of any type to achieve a vertical propulsive landing of an orbital rocket booster and the first to reuse such a booster. The company&apos;s Falcon 9 rockets have landed and flown again more than 300 times. As of December 2023, SpaceX has around US$180 billion valuation.</p>
